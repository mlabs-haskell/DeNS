These features are:&#xA;Records must be stored in an immutable, permanent, and public database. Users must have the ability (at least in principle) to resolve queries locally - that is, it ought to be possible for a user to reconstruct the DeNS database solely from public information, and use that database to resolve queries without sharing those queries (or the identity of the user) with any third party Users must be provided with direct control over their records, such that they can update those records without the assent or intervention of any third party.</description>
