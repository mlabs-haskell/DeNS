      <description>DeNS Query Layer Development Milestone Outputs&#xA;A package that listens to Cardano transactions that are related to DeNS and populates a relational database. This serves as the main query layer for other applications like DNS analytics (we expect this to be particularly useful for security-related applications) but also as the database from which traditional DNS service integration can take place.&#xA;The package which listens to Cardano transactions that are related to DeNS and populates a relational database can be found here.</description>

      <description>DeNS Control Layer Development Milestone Outputs&#xA;An &amp;#39;offchain&amp;#39; (which is a bit more substantial here than in most dapps) component that can build DeNS transactions and can be exposed to users through CLIs, GUIs, and APIs.&#xA;An offchain component that can build DeNS transactions exposed via a CLI is provided here.&#xA;Minimally, a basic DeNS CLI utility that can be used to meaningfully interact with the protocol.&#xA;The CLI utility is provided as a flake output here.</description>

      <description>Deployment, Documentation, Productionizing Milestone Outputs&#xA;A deployment-ready package or container (Nix/Docker) is made available for users&#xA;Such packages are all available with Nix as a flake output:&#xA;dens-query-cli&#xA;dens-transactions-cli&#xA;dens-pdns-backend&#xA;Docker images and a Compose file to run the system on the Preview testnet are available here and here respectively.&#xA;Extensive tests, including golden tests where applicable/useful, are implemented for each of the DeNS components&#xA;An integration test suite which verifies data is piped between each component correctly can be found here</description>
