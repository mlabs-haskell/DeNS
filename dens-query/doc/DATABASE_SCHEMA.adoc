== Database Schema

NOTE: Readers may skip this section.

DeNS query uses PostgreSQL with many PostgreSQL specific extensions.
In particular, the PostgreSQL specific extensions were used to respond to blockchain rollbacks 
where the blockchain will rollback to a particular block 
requiring the protocol to undo all the changes from the present to the block to rollback to.
